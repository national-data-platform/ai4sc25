    <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
    <p>We invite submissions to the Workshop on Generative AI and FAIR Principles in Science Communication (AI4SC-2024), co-located with the 20th IEEE e-Science 2024. This workshop explores the intersection of generative AI, FAIR principles, and scientific communication and software. Topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Generative AI and LLM to communicate scientific innovations</li>
        <li>AI-driven techniques for scientific communication and software repositories</li>
        <li>Blue-sky research: Future AI for scientific software and repositories</li>
        <li>Different approaches to process data, like RAG, finetuning, agentic AI</li>
        <li>Novel methods for improving software discovery, usability, FAIRness, and automation</li>
        <li>AI-powered software and repository similarity analysis and documentation generation</li>
        <li>Constructing, deploying, and managing ontologies from domain repositories using generative AI</li>
        <li>Next-generation GenAI for scientific software and repository interaction to communicate scientific methodology and technique</li>
        <li>AI-powered software and repository discovery & reusability, creating better protocols for scientific communities</li>
        <li>Privacy risks of scientific communication through generative AI, including access control, machine learning, and more</li>
        <li>Privacy-preserving heterogeneous data repositories</li>
        <li>LLM-based agentic pipelines for scientific workflows</li>
        <li>Breakthroughs in LLM for scientific advancements using big data and HPC techniques</li>
        <li>Integrating knowledge graphs and ontologies with generative AI for innovation and result representation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The workshop welcomes the following types of submissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Full papers</strong> (10 pages including references): Presenting novel research, systems, or case studies.</li>
        <li><strong>Posters</strong> (2 pages): Showcasing early-stage results or standalone innovations.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All submissions will be single-blind peer reviewed. Accepted full papers will be presented orally. Posters will be featured in a dedicated session. Both will appear in the e-Science 2024 proceedings. Rejected full papers may be re-submitted as posters.</p>

    <p>At least one author per accepted submission must register for the workshop at the full rate. Each author registration covers one accepted paper/poster.</p>

    <p>Manuscripts should follow the <a href="http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE 8.5Ã—11 format</a> with double-column, single-spaced 10-point font.</p>
