                <p>Please submit your papers by the deadline listed in the Important Dates section.</p>
                <p>The conference is soliciting two types of contributions:
                    Full papers (10 pages including references) presenting previously unpublished research achievements or eScience experiences and solutions
                    Posters (2 pages) showcasing standalone research, innovations or early-stage results that are anticipated to develop into a full paper
                    Submitted papers should use the IEEE 8.5×11 manuscript guidelines: double-column text using single-spaced 10-point font on 8.5×11-inch pages. Templates are available from http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html. All submissions will be single-blind peer reviewed. Selected full papers will receive a slot for an oral presentation. Accepted posters will be presented during a poster reception. Accepted full papers and poster papers will be published in the conference proceedings. Rejected full papers can be re-submitted for a poster presentation. At least one author of each accepted paper or poster must register as an author at the full registration rate. Each author registration can be applied to only one accepted submission.</p>
